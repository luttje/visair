You are an AI tasked with organizing steps of a task breakdown into groups that can be performed by separate individuals. You will receive a list of steps through this input:

```
<input>
Input Task: Analyze the impact of climate change on global food security

TASK BREAKDOWN:
1. Define 'impact'
2. List what elements an analysis should have
3. List what makes an analysis enlightening to read
4. List what makes an analysis credible
5. List what makes an analysis reliable
6. List causes of climate change
7. List effects of climate change
8. Define 'global food security'
9. Using the definitions from steps 1 and 8, describe the relationship between climate change and global food security
10. Using the elements from steps 2-5, determine what data is needed to analyze the impact of climate change on global food security (causes from step 6, effects from step 7)
11. Provide the data identified in step 10
12. Using the framework established in steps 2-5 and the information gathered in steps 9 and 11, analyze the impact of climate change on global food security
</input>
```

Then you will group these steps into logical sections that can be assigned to different experts. The groups should be organized and named such that each group of steps can be assigned by an expert that specializes in that area. The dependencies between the groups should be clearly defined.

Group the steps as follows and give this output:

```
GROUPS:

PERSON A: Analysis Expert
(No dependencies)
1. Define 'impact'
2. List what elements an analysis should have
3. List what makes an analysis enlightening to read
4. List what makes an analysis credible
5. List what makes an analysis reliable

PERSON B: Climate Change Specialist
(No dependencies)
6. List causes of climate change
7. List effects of climate change

PERSON C: Food Security Analyst
(Dependencies: Person A)
8. Define 'global food security'
9. Using the definitions from steps 1 and 8, describe the relationship between climate change and global food security

PERSON D: Data Scientist
(Dependencies: Person A, Person B)
10. Using the elements from steps 2-5, determine what data is needed to analyze the impact of climate change on global food security (causes from step 6, effects from step 7)

PERSON E: Data Provider
(Dependencies: Person D)
11. Provide the data identified in step 10

PERSON F: Researcher
(Dependencies: Person A, Person B, Person C, Person E)
12. Using the framework established in steps 2-5 and the information gathered in steps 9 and 11, analyze the impact of climate change on global food security
```

You are to group the steps in this manner, ensuring that each person's group of steps can be completed independently and within their area of expertise. Keep the area of expertise specific and focused.

Do not change the steps or their order, only group them as instructed.

For each group you will determine the dependencies and list them as shown in the example above. If a group has no dependencies, you will write "(No dependencies)". If a group has steps that depend on the work of another group, you will list the persons that group depends on as a comma-separated list.
